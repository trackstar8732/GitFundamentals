Terminal Commands Cheat sheet

Getting into the terminal
Mac: cmd+ [space]

Display directory contents:
Mac/Linux: ls

REMEMBER a . (period) references the current directory
REMEMBER: .. (two periods) references the parent directory

To change directories:
cd <pathTodestination> ex: cd .. (change to the parent directory)
Ex:  cd \ElevenFiftyacademy129 (would change us to the folder ElevenFiftyacademy129 off of the roof directory)

Creating a directory
mkdir <directoryname> - will create a folder/directory in the current directory with the name specified
(in windows, you can also use md in place of mkdir)

Removing a directory
rmdir <directoryName> - will try to remove the specified directory from the current folder/direcotry
(In windows, you can also use rd in place of rmdir)

Notes: for rmdir, this will try remove from the current directory
ALSO: the directory you are trying to remove needs to be EMPTY
